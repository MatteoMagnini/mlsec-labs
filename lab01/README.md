# Lab 01: Malware Detection with ML

In this lab, you will learn how to use notebooks, and compute Precision, Recall, F1-Score and ROC Curves for malware detection. 

* `lab01.ipynb` is a notebook which first contains an example on how to perform a feature embedding on a simple dataset. At the end of the notebook, there is an "Exercise" section which contains a description of the exercise to be doing.
